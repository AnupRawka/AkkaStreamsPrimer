#Batch Processsing with Akka Streams

##What you'll build
Akka streams provides both Java and Scala based API, for this primer we will be using Scala. This Primer
will walk you through the steps to build a simple streaming Data Transformation and processing flow. The primer shows an example
of processing CSV data through file.
It takes an CSV data, converts it to Json record based on provided schema and write it back to a file. I tried
to document every function and concept.

## What you'll need
You will need Intellij and Scala (latest stable) and SBT (latest Stable).
